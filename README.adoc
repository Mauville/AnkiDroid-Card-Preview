= AnkiDroid Card Style Previewer

== Usage

. Get the https://github.com/Mauville/AnkiDroid-Card-Preview/releases/latest[latest release] and edit away using your favourite editor. 
. Once you finish, copy the HTML, CSS and scripts to Anki.

Unfortunately, you can only preview cards correctly using Chrome/Chromium browsers.

The file structure is so done so you can use placeholder images and scripts in your preview. Place all of them besides the main HTML file. 
However, in practice, all of the files should come from your collection.media directory.

I also ask of you, that if you use this template to design your cards, you include the header in the CSS file in your final Anki cards.

== Explanation

I wanted to design good-looking cards for AnkiDroid but the debugging and previewing process was a mess. I had to sync every time I wanted to see how the cards looked and that process took ages.

Since Anki and AnkiDroid use Chrome WebView to display cards, I decided to create an file structure similar to that of those to easily preview cards and modify as you would with any other HTML page.

In short, instead of designing cards inside Anki lousy Cards screen, you can design cards as if it were just another webpage and then copy your code to Anki.

Convenient mobile card designing advice included!

You can also use the debugging tools on Android to change the card CSS directly.
However, it is a much more complicated and error prone process than just using the files.

. Download the alpha release APK from https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/releases[here]
. Install and enable HTML/Javascript debugging in Advanced Preferences.
. Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging in Android setings
. Connect your device to your computer and activate debugging.
. Using Chrome on the same computer open chrome://inspect and you should see the webview on the emulator. Click inspect for that WebView and you'll get a full Chrome remote debugging console.
